## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is structured in **three main sections**:

### 1. SOC KPI Overview
High-impact KPIs displayed with executive-level clarity:
- **MTTR (Mean Time To Resolve)** – Average resolution time per incident  
- **Total Incidents** – Number of reported incidents  
- **Average Financial Loss per Incident**  
- **Top Attack Type (by volume)**  
- **Top Target Industry**  
- **Most Common Vulnerability Type**

### 2. Threat Landscape
Visualizations to understand attack patterns and impact:
- **Incidents by Attack Type (Bar Chart)** – DDoS, Phishing, MITM, SQL Injection, Ransomware  
- **Financial Loss by Attack Type (Column Chart)** – Highlights high-impact threats  
- **Incidents by Country vs Industry (Heatmap)** – Regional exposure per industry  
- **Trends Over Years (Line Chart)** – Evolution of incidents over time

### 3. SOC Operations Performance
Analytics on SOC efficiency and incident resolution:
- **MTTR by Attack Type** – Speed of response per threat  
- **MTTR by Country** – Operational complexity by region  
- **Users Affected vs Financial Loss (Scatter Plot)** – Correlation between impact and economic loss

### Bonus Visuals
- **Ribbon Chart** – Evolution of attack type rankings  
- **Map Visualization** – Geographic distribution of incidents
